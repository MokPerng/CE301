# 法斯世界
X-ASS星系是双太阳星系，这意味着X-ASS星球的生存环境非常恶劣，而在这样的环境中诞生的物种极其强大，拥有丰富的先进科技。

法斯是 X-ASS 中的行星之一。它类似于地球，有液态水和大气层。它是X-ASS中最适合生存的星球。所有在法斯出生的孩子都会在10岁时会觉醒一个灵魂伴侣--Famon。Famon的来历很神秘。它们无处不在，也因为不同的环境，诞生了不同的属性和独特的技能。

Fass 的技术水平很高，但为了让地球可持续发展，他们在 200 年前制定了一项法案，以保持地球的健康和生态发展，将总部设于地球的外圈--大型空间站 The Bridge，因此只有年满 10 岁并获得 4 名守护者批准的训练员才有资格加入 The Bridge。

故事从一个刚满 10 岁的孤儿开始……
